For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

## Project Structure

/app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
/app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
/app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.

/scripts: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.

## Prisma

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access and management for developers. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for working with databases in a type-safe and efficient manner. Prisma supports various databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server.

Key features of Prisma include:

Declarative Data Modeling: Developers can define data models using a declarative syntax, which Prisma then translates into the corresponding database schema.

Automatic Migration: Prisma can automatically generate and apply database migrations based on changes to data models, making it easier to manage schema changes over time.

Type-Safety: Prisma generates type-safe client libraries for accessing the database, ensuring that data operations are type-checked at compile time.

Query Builder: Prisma provides a query builder that allows developers to write database queries using a fluent and intuitive syntax, reducing the risk of errors and improving productivity.

Real-Time Data Sync: Prisma supports real-time data synchronization through subscriptions, allowing applications to receive updates from the database in real time.

Overall, Prisma aims to streamline the development process by offering a modern and developer-friendly approach to database management and access.
